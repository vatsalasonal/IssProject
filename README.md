Retrofit Implementation with Dagger2

This project is demonstration on Dagger2 (Dependency Injection) using Retrofit, DataBinding and RxJava to execute network request. 

**Retrofit** is a REST Client library (Helper Library) used in Android and Java to create an HTTP request and also to process the 
HTTP response from a REST API. It was created by Square, you can also use retrofit to receive data structures other than JSON, 
for example SimpleXML and Jackson. Before we continue, letâ€™s briefly define REST Client and REST API in our context.

**REST Client** in our case is the Retrofit library that is used on the client side (Android) to make HTTP request to REST API.

A **REST API** defines a set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET and POST.

**Dagger** is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version 
created by Square and now maintained by Google.

**RxJava** is used to manage network request and response.
